Summary:  We are intruducing some distance metrics which are commonly used on measure similarity in machine learning.

## Euclidean Distance
**Euclidean distance** is the "ordianary" disctance between two points in Euclidean space. The points in Euclidean space (N-Space) are called Euclidean vectors. The Euclidean distance of vector of vector ***P*** and vector ***Q*** can be computed as follows:
